# Weather_Dashboard
## Description
In this project we used third party APIs to obtain weather data. Allowing the user to input any city they wish and gain both the current weather and a 5-day expected forecast for that area. Once the user seaches a city that information is logged in localStorage and noted on the webpage as a recent search so the information provided can be accessed again easily.
